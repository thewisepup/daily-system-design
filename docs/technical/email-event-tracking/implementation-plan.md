# Email Event Tracking Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement comprehensive email tracking for bounce handling, operational monitoring, and advertiser analytics with focus on CTR, engagement patterns, time-to-open analysis, and subscriber lifetime value.

## Phase 1: Real-Time Bounce Handling
- **Goal:** Prevent hard bounces from remaining subscribed
- **Development:** Use ngrok for localhost webhook testing (`ngrok http 3000`)
- **Production Testing:** SES test emails (bounce@simulator.amazonses.com) as alternative
- **Implementation:** Next.js `/api/webhook/ses-bounce` API route with SNS validation
- **Action:** Update user subscription status to 'cancelled' on hard bounces only
- **Infrastructure:** Separate SNS topics for dev/staging/prod environments (us-west-2)

## Phase 2: Operational Monitoring  
- **Goal:** CloudWatch visibility for email delivery operations
- **Data Flow:** SES config sets → CloudWatch metrics
- **Dashboard:** Transactional vs Newsletter emails with filtering
- **Events:** All SES events (send, delivery, bounce, complaint, open, click)
- **Future TODOs:** Alarm thresholds and notification setup

## Phase 3: Analytics Data Lake
- **Architecture:** Kinesis Firehose → S3 → Athena
- **S3 Structure:** Simplified date partitioning: `year/month/day/`
- **Lifecycle Policy:** Standard (0-30 days) → Standard-IA (30+ days), retain forever
- **Partition Management:** Manual `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` initially, AWS Glue Crawler later
- **Message Tagging:** Ready for advertiser/campaign ID via SES message tags

## Phase 4: Redshift Extension (Future)
- **Timeline:** When advertiser onboarding begins
- **Purpose:** High-performance dashboards for advertiser reporting
- **Data Source:** Same S3 bucket, structured schema design
- **Campaign Tracking:** Via SES message tags integration

## Key Analytics Metrics

### Core Advertiser Metrics
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Clicks / Opens (engagement quality)
- **Engagement Rate:** (Opens + Clicks) / Delivered emails
- **Time to Open:** Latency between delivery and first open
- **Multiple Engagement:** Users with multiple opens, forwards, repeat clicks

### Subscriber Analytics  
- **Subscriber Lifetime Value:** Long-term engagement patterns and retention
- **Deliverability Metrics:** Delivery rate, bounce rate, unsubscribe rate
- **Temporal Patterns:** Best send times, engagement decay curves
- **Audience Segmentation:** New vs returning subscriber performance

## Technical Implementation

### Infrastructure Components
1. **SNS Topics:** Separate dev/staging/prod webhook endpoints
2. **Next.js API Route:** `/api/webhook/ses-bounce` with validation
3. **S3 Bucket:** Date-partitioned storage with lifecycle policies
4. **Kinesis Firehose:** Raw JSON event streaming with compression
5. **Athena Tables:** Optimized schemas for analytical queries
6. **CloudWatch Dashboards:** Real-time operational monitoring

### Data Schema Design
- **Raw Events:** Preserve all SES event data for flexibility
- **Partitioning:** Date-based for efficient querying and cost optimization
- **Message Tags:** Structured advertiser/campaign metadata support
- **Query Optimization:** Index strategies for common analytical patterns

## Success Criteria
- **Bounce Handling:** Hard bounces immediately unsubscribe users
- **Monitoring:** Real-time CloudWatch metrics for all email operations  
- **Analytics:** Athena queries provide comprehensive advertiser reporting
- **Scalability:** System handles growth from 500 to 2K+ subscribers seamlessly
- **Extensibility:** Foundation supports future campaign-level tracking and Redshift migration
